Feature: #33071 - Add the http header "Content-Language" when rendering a page
==============================================================================

Description
===========

By default a header "Content-language: XX" is sent where "XX" is the iso code of the sys_language_content if that is
properly defined by the sys_language record representing the sys_language_uid.
The "config.disableLanguageHeader" will disable that.



Impact
======

By default in new and existing installations a header "Content-language: XX" is sent where "XX" is the iso code of the
sys_language_content if that is properly defined by the sys_language record representing the sys_language_uid.
You must set "config.disableLanguageHeader" to disable that and get previous behavior (no header).
