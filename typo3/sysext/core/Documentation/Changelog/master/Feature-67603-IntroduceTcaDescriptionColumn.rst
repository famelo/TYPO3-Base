Description
===========

To annotate database table column fields as internal description for editors and admins a new setting
for TCA is introduced. Setting is called ``['TCA']['ctrl']['descriptionColumn']`` and holds column name.

This description should only displayed in the backend to guide editors and admins.

Usage of descriptionColumn is added under different issues.

None, since annotation itself is added only. Does not impact.
